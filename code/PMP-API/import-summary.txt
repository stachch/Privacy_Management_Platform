ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => PMPAPI\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\jpmpps-lib-latest.jar => PMPAPI\libs\jpmpps-lib-latest.jar
* libs\pmp-xml-util-stable-latest.jar => PMPAPI\libs\pmp-xml-util-stable-latest.jar
* res\ => PMPAPI\src\main\res\
* src\ => PMPAPI\src\main\java\
* src\de\unistuttgart\ipvs\pmp\shared\service\app\IAppService.aidl => PMPAPI\src\main\aidl\de\unistuttgart\ipvs\pmp\shared\service\app\IAppService.aidl
* src\de\unistuttgart\ipvs\pmp\shared\service\pmp\IPMPService.aidl => PMPAPI\src\main\aidl\de\unistuttgart\ipvs\pmp\shared\service\pmp\IPMPService.aidl
* src\de\unistuttgart\ipvs\pmp\shared\service\pmp\RegistrationResult.aidl => PMPAPI\src\main\aidl\de\unistuttgart\ipvs\pmp\shared\service\pmp\RegistrationResult.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
